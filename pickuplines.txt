I'd really like to Poke-her-hontas. @
Sit on my face and ask me to lie... What? You've never been Pinocchio'd? @

Yours is the only meat I will ever put in my body. @
I wanna paint you green and spank you like a disobedient avocado. @
Would you like some organic roasted root vegetables to go with that non-dairy fair trade shake? @
I bet you could really go for a hot veggie dog right about now. @
I am sure we could both reach the big O in no time. Organic that is. @
My heart is certified cage-free, so my love can roam to you. @
Even though I'm a vegetarian, I still need my daily dose of meat and protein.@
I bought some new hemp sheets, wanna try them out? @

What's a girl like you doing in a place like this when there's a Farscape marathon on right now on the Sci Fi channel. @
I've been told I have the cool sexual prowess of a Romulan. @
"Urkuk lu Stalga." That's Klingon for "I love you baby." @
If you think Chewbacca is hairy, wait until you see my wookie! @
Once you make love to a man with Vulcan ears on you never go back. @
How 'bout I slip into something more comfortable... like these STAR TREK VOYAGER pajamas!@
Nice buns, Princess! On your head, that is. @
Not only can I beam you aboard, I can beam you a woody. @

I'm a bit tired, so can we just play your backside tonight? @
I'm still working on my approach, but I think I have a pretty good swing. @

Do you know what the Indiana Pacers and I have in common? Solid D. @
You may have heard that I'm a great ballhandler. Wanna sample my skills? @
Your Jordan jersey looks nice, but I bet it'd look even nicer on my bedroom floor. @
Instead of zone defense, what do you say we play some man-to-woman coverage tonight? @

You be the Bulls and I'll bring the Heat! @
If you were a basketball, would you let me lay you up? @

Are you a flyer? Because I want to pick you up. @
I wish I were your back spot so I could touch your butt.@
I’ll love you like a flyer loves not bring dropped.@
Hey cutie, I can really teach you how to yell.@
I received a 0.5 deduction for falling for you.@
Can you teach me the counts? Specifically, the counts to your heart.@
I’d love to see the way you handle my spirit stick.@
Would you like a banana to go with those splits?@
Do you believe in love at first sight of someone’s butt?@
I must say that high school was hell, but you were the hottest thing there.@
Do you have any tape? Because I'm totally ripped. @
This elliptical isn't the only thing getting my heart rate up. @
Girl, do you need to get your protein macros up? Because I'd gladly put my meat inside you@
I know a fun activity that can burn 500 calories an hour... @
I got stopped by a police officer on the way here. He told me it was illegal to carry these guns in public. @
How'd you like to be my special push-up partner? @
Do you squat here often? @
I'm gonna have my 'whey' with you! @
Let's do lunge. @

My personal trainer told me I had to come talk to you for five minutes as part of my routine. @
Do you believe in love at first set? Or should I curl this barbell another 10 times? @

And I don't just mean my skeleton. @
Is your tank top felt? [No] Would you like it to be? @
I hope you know CPR, because you just took my breath away! Or maybe it was the hour I spent on this treadmill.@

How was your last skinny dip? I bet I can make your next one better. @
Nice beach balls, can I play? @
I don't know which is prettier today, the water, the sky or your eyes. @
They called me the human torpedo even before I took up swimming.@
Let’s go back to my place and get out of these wet clothes.@
If beauty were a grain of sand, you’d be a million beaches. @
You’re a wealthy neglected housewife, I’m a pool boy. It's practically required by law that you do me. @
I wanna pound you the way the ocean pounds the surf. @

Thank you for helping me make my hand. All I needed was a Queen! @
Looks like you’ve got top and bottom pair covered. @
Can you please stop staring at my chip stack? @
How good are your lips at blowing on dice?@
You get 25 percent of the bill and 100 percent of my heart. Call me?@
Can I sweep you off your practical, orthopedic waitress shoes? @
My burger was great, but YOU are rare and well-done at the same time. @
You brought me lunch, can I bring you dinner? @
Is there a non-creepy way to hit on your waiter? If so, please text it to me. @
I just kept ordering coffee so you’d talk to me. Now I just have to pee.@
You’d be the perfect woman, even if your hair didn’t smell like French fries.@
My idiot friend thinks you’re cute. I told him he was wrong—you’re gorgeous. Call me when your shift ends?@
I have a big tip for you but you will have to receive it in private. @
Since you are on your feet all day, I figured you’d like to go lay down with me when you are done?@
I love it when a girl knows her fried foods. @
So when’s your next night off? @
What time do you get off? Well what time do you get out of work? @
Is work the only place that you are good at serving?@
Gun DAM, you are FINE girl!@
Damn, girl, you must be a hollow.@
You make my zanpaku-to go bankai.@
Sometimes my friends call me Speed Racer, because adventure’s always waiting just ahead. @
Why don’t we go back to my place and find my Dragonballs? @
I was just checking you out from across the room with my Sharingan. @
I came over because I notice your chakra use is limited, and well let’s just say I really know how to get your chakra flowing. @
All the nubile lolis in my harem don’t think that I’m a complete loser. @
Why don't you come over to my house so we can watch a little Sailor Moon to get in the mood? @
Do they make you in hug pillow? @
I promise, I can always find a girls G-Force. @
I carry around my dead sister’s cell phone. Wanna sleep together? @
There’s enough Ai in Jailbait for the both of us. If you go out with me, I’ll treat you how I treat my Pocky. I’ll spend a lot of money on you, bring you home and finish you off within 5 minutes before I lay in bed crying myself to sleep.@
You can be my Henrietta and I will be your Guiseppe. @
Let’s find a quiet place to connect and form Voltron. @
My extensive Master Grade Gunpla collection is just proof of my magic fingers. @
Do you have a tampon I can put in my nostril? Because my nose started bleeding when I saw you. @
Yamato - "you seem a bit stiff, but i still got wood" @
Gaara - "Ever been shukaku'd?" @
Naruto - "I've got nine tails, think you can take them all in one shot?" @
Excuse me, is your name Hina? Because I think I’m in love.@
You wanna ride on my 'hog? @
Are you impressed with how I handle my sniper? You should see what I can do with the weapon I pack under my armor. @
I usually press “X” to pick up weapons. Does that work for picking YOU up as well? @
I think something is wrong with my auto-aim. I can’t take my eyes off you. @
Do you need a Magnum because I’ve got one right here for you. In my pants. @
Are we playing Assault? Cause I’m pretty sure you are the bomb. @
When I came near you, the announcer said “unfreakinbelievable”... I would have to agree. @
What do you say I take my flag to your base and score? @
I’m like a plasma grenade. Let me get on you and you are guaranteed to explode. @
(eyeing the breast plate) I am a master dual wielder. Mind if I give those a go? @
I was following the indicator of where to score and it brought me to you. @
I would like to gain access to your base. Shall I enter from the front or the rear?@
Are you a care package? Because you must've fallen from heaven.@
Are you up for a little tactical insertion? @
That's not an m60 in my pants, I'm just happy to see you. @
I'd catch a grenade for you... it's ok, I've got FlakJacket pro! @
How many COD points does it take to unlock you? @
You gave me hardened pro in just 6 seconds. @
Watch out girl, my predator missile is coming at you from behind! @
You just made me shoot a MOAB in my pants. @
Girl, you should never pick up a ballistic vest - it would be a shame to cover up your two best attachments. @
I use Full Metal Jacket for deeper penetration. @
Are you using hacks? Cause as soon as you joined this lobby I got a hardened perk. @
You're so hot, you warm my cold-blooded heart. @
Do you like my long barrel?@
If you were a map pack, I'd download you. @
The odds of meeting a girl as amazing as you, are the same as the odds of hitting a no-scope shot from across the map. @
All I have to do is press "X" to pick up a weapon. Does that work for picking you up as well? @
I think something is wrong with my auto-aim. I can't take my eyes off you. @
Let me know when you're close, so I can use my blast shield. It was a mess last time. @
I would run around the world for you... without lightweight. @
How 'bout we meet at Underpass and I'll Tactically insert you. @
Even if you were wearing a ghillie suit, you'd still be the most beautiful girl here. @
Wanna leave this lobby and go into a private match? @
Getting this tactical nuke was the hardest thing I've ever done. I hope getting your phone number won't be as difficult. @
Even though it would mess up my K/D ratio, I'd die a million deaths if it meant I could be with you. @
What class are you using? Because when I press select, you're at the top of my list. @
Do you believe in love at first sight, or should I rejoin this lobby? @
Sitcky going out! Sorry, you're just that hot! @
How 'bout coming back to my place and helping me work on my next montage - it won't be a Call of Duty one this time.@
If I had the choice, I'd spend my 100 coins on you instead of on an extra life. @
If Princess Toadstool looked anything like you, I would have killed Bowser years ago! @
I'd rather ride you than Yoshi any day. @
Are you a magic feather? Because my heart just grew a tail, and flew away. @
I know how Mario must feel, 'cause I really want to clean your pipes. @
Are you a magic mushroom? Because you are making me grow. @
Are you a magic flower? Because you are burning me up. @
You don't have to turn on a game to play with me. @
They don't call me Super for nothing. @
If you were a warp tube, I'd be in you all day. @
Mario is red. Sonic is blue. Press start to join and be my player 2.@
Do you have the Mirror Shield? Because I can really see myself in your tunic. @
Are you wearing the Pegasus Boots? Because you've been running though my mind all day. @
What's a girl like you doing in a Forest Temple like this? @
You light my Deku Stick on fire. @
I'm not possessed by Majora's Mask, I'm just crazy for you. @
I'd better put on my Goron tunic, because you're too damn hot. @
I wanna make you wetter than the Zora Temple. @
You should come back to my place. My master sword needs to be polished. @
You're not 18 yet? No problem, I know the Song of Time. @
How 'bout you come back to my place and I show you my Longshot @
Hey baby, can I buy you a potion? @
Baby, I've been Z-targeting you all night. @
I'd better buy a bigger bag, because you are the BOMB! @
I must have defeated a boss, because I just found a heart container. @
Want to fuse Kinstones? I'd bet they fit perfectly. @
Are you a Deku Nut? Because you're stunning me. @
I'm gonna be Bigocto this time, and I'm gonna suck you up. @
You must be King Dodongo, because I really want to explode inside your mouth. @
You are hotter than Din's fire.@
Do you have a Diamond Pickaxe? Because I'm as hard as Obsidian. @
You must be made of bonemeal, cause you make me grow 10 feet tall. @
I'd like to fertilize your crops with my bonemeal. @
Are you a slimeball? Cause you make my piston sticky If you were ore, I'd mine you all night long! @
You must be ice, because I've been waiting to pick you up for a long time. @
You must be a redstone torch, because you're extending my piston! @
Are you a lever? Because you turn me on. @
You must be from nether, because you are out of this world. @
Are you a torch? Because you light up my world. @
You must be a pressure plate, because you turn me on. @
Are you a pig? Because I wanna ride you. @
Is that a creeper in your pants or are you just happy to see me? @
I'm like a zombie and you're like the sun - you light me on fire! @
I must be gravel, because I'm falling for you.@
I’m gonna take u to pleasant park and shove my shifty shaft inside your dusty depot.@
Is your name Mire? Because I'm making you Moisty. @
I'd jump off a floating bus for you. @
Wanna feel my shifty shaft? @
Have you ever been sprayed by a mini gun? @
Want me to Grease up your Grove tonight? @
Did you come from Tilted Towers? because I would Tilt you over!@
If you were a chest, I would loot you. @
I promise I ain't no double-pump chump@
I just survived TItled Towers, so I'm totally looted up right now @
I want my shifty shaft to visit your moisty mire @
Did you come from the lodge? Because I wouldn't make you lonely.@
Call Me Cupid Cause I Just Landed a Crossbow Shot to your Heart.@
My health is low and I have no shield and no weapon. The only cure is for me to chug on those jugs of yours and for you to give me a little pump action.@
If we were the last 2 people on earth, I'd throw a boogie bomb down so we can dance together forever.@
You turned my pants into a Moisty Mire.@
Hey girl, you don’t require 1600g for my Needlessly Large Rod. @
You don’t need to press ‘E’ to charm me. @
Is your name Janna? Because you blow me away. @
Is your name Rammus? Because you rolled right into my life. @
Will you carry me? @
Hey honey, regardless of the possibility that you deny me, I’ll pursue you like I carelessly pursue singed’s smelly ass. @
You like diamonds, right? Well, I’m diamond in League of Legends. @
I don’t recollect much from my past in any case, I do recall that you are in it. @
Are you a minion because I can cs together. @
Hey babe, wanna return to my base and look at my Needlessly Large Rod? @
You know what’s the difference between me and u? You can’t milk these. @
You are so beautiful I can’t look away; unless of course, you see me, then I turn invisible. @
Hey young lady, you can call me the Last Whisperer, since I’m here for a great deal of Physical Penetration. @
Hey baby, if being hot and sexy was a crime, I’d need to call Sherif Caitlyn because you’re guilty as charged. @
You should be accustomed to taking souls, since you’re completely stacked.@
Do you have heat vision, too? Because you can melt my heart with just a look. @
You must be made of Kryptonite because being around you makes my knees weak. @
I can fly anywhere in the solar system, but only you can take me to heavan. @
I think your clothes are made of Kryptonite, we’ve got to get rid of them immediately. @
Hey, baby, wanna come back to my fortress of solitude? @
I can see anything within miles of here, but there's nothing I'd rather look at than you. @
You know, I once lifted a whole rocket into orbit. Wanna find out how high I can take you? @
Excuse me, I'm from another planet. Can you teach me about human anatomy? @
You know, I can hold my breath for 20 minutes... @

Excuse me, are you into reverse bifurcation? @

If we went on a date, what do you think our profit and loss would be? @
In all the power meetings I’ve ever been to, this room is one of the hottest... for real, it’s hot! @
Just like your paid search campaign, you’ve made quite the impression on me.@
Me without you is like a marketer without analytics. Lost, visionless, and confused.@
Who needs a financial analysis when I know exactly where to put my money.@
Are you involved in Business? Because you really know how to position yourself for me.@

(One tall person to another) Finally, someone I can see eye-to-eye on everything with!@
(One tall person to another) It's nice how easy it is for us to check each other out across the room. We should go sit down somewhere though so the next tallest people have a chance.@
By you, like your shade, I’ll ever dwell@
Is this a dagger I see before me? Nay! Im merely happy to cast eyes upon thy beauty!@
My heart, it pines, as my trousers tent.@

Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of my bed. @
Stop! Don't you know it is illegal to look that fine? @
Do you know how fast you were going when you fell from heaven? @
Spread em’!! @
I have a great idea for those handcuffs. @
Bullproof vest? Nah, it's all muscle. @
Ever seen a baton this big? @
I’d love you to frisk me. @
I'm ready to enforce the law of attraction. @
I'm writing you a ticket - you’ve got ”fine" written all over you. @
Is that a gun in your pocket, or are you just happy to see me?@
Let's go to my place for some under-cover work. @
My cuffs or your cuffs tonight?@
Nice uniform, it would look great at the foot of my bed. @
I hear cops like a big bust. @
Want to plant something on me? @
Want to play good cop bad cop? @
You have the right to remain silent, but I doubt you will. @
What else do you do with that night stick? @
I always turn on my siren when I spot a siren. @
Did I tell you that I live next door to Dunkin Donuts? @
Step out of the vehicle. Walk a straight line into my life. @
Stick with me and those lights won’t be the only thing flashing. @
I'm not here to bust you... I'm here for your bust.@
Damn, I'm now gonna have to rewrite my Zombie Plan to include you. @
Did it hurt when you fell from Heaven? Or when you landed on that sharp stick? You should probably take that out, you know. @
Hey girl, I'd love to eat your brains out @
Do you have a little zombie in you? Would you like some? @
Am I Daryl Dixon? Because I have an arrow and I'd like to penetrate you. @
Hurry! Walkers are almost here, say you'll go out with me! @
Are you a Walker? Because you just walked away with my heart. @
Are you a zombie? [no] Want some? @
Are you into necrophilia? @
I Chews Chews Chews You! @
Hey, wanna Rigor my Mortis? @
Are you Michonne's cat? Because you are just too damn gorgeous! @
Are you tired? Because you've been dragging your feet around my mind all day @
Your beauty is eating away at my heart. @
How many walkers will it take for me to kill until you have sex with me? @
Hey. You look kinda cute with those twisted legs, torn off jaw and eye dangling on your cheek @
Are those maggots in your pocket or are you just happy to see me? @
It is the end of the world. Let's make love until we feel alive again. @
I have no idea where Carl is, but I'm 100% sure that I want you. @
I like my sex how I like to kill Walkers: quick and dirty@
Charles Dickens might have given you Great Expectations, but I can meet them. @
Are you Five People? 'Cause I just met you, and I'm in Heaven. @
As I Lay Dying…my biggest regret was not telling you how beautiful you are. @
I wanna do Wild Things wherever you Are. @
I believe in The Importance of Being Earnest, so I'm just going to say it: I'm Wilde about you. @
I Sense you have a lot of Sensibility. Was that too Austen-tatious of me to point out? @
I'd like to end your Age of Innocence. @
Are you an overdue book? Because you have fine written all over you! @
I know For Whom the Bell Tolls, so why don't you call me sometime? @
I spend Tuesdays with Morrie, but I want to spend every other day with you. @
I'm no Jane, but I'd Eyre on the side of saying I think you're beautiful. @
If I had a flower for every time I thought of you, I'd have a Secret Garden. @
Is it 451 degrees Fahrenheit in here, or is it just you?@
Is your name Harriet? Cause I caught you spyin' on me. @
Is your name Scarlett? Because when I saw you my heart was gone with the wind. @
The Sun isn't the only thing around here that Also Rises. @
Wanna go find us A Room of One's Own? @
If it was 1984, and I was Big Brother, I'd only watch you. @
I'd Revisit your Brideshead anytime. @
I'd Fight to go to a Club with you. @
Hey girl, don't be The Stranger. @
I'd like to Catch 22 of you. @
My friends call me Robert, but you can call me The Beowulf. @
My Heart was a Lonely Hunter 'til I met you, girl. @
I like books, you like books, why don't we start writing the story of us? @
Babe, if you were words on a page, you'd be what they call fine print. @
Would you like to peek at my hardcover? @
I have a library card, do you mind if I check you out? @
I want to take your body to Wuthering Heights.@
I'd love to buy you a drink from the open bar. @
I know you're in the middle of the father-daughter dance, but I'm going to go ahead and cut in. @
If you’re the bride, congratulations. If not, can I have your number? @
No, I didn’t drink too much wedding champagne... I'm just intoxicated by you! @
I like your last name. Can I have it? @
We might as well get to know one another. We'll probably be seeing each other at baby showers and anniversary parties. @
Wouldn't we look cute on a wedding cake together? @
I want the kind of marriage that makes my kids want to get married. @
I'm not the wedding photographer, but I can picture us together. @
You sure did a nice job of catching that bouquet. Let's go back to my hotel room and test your other reflexes. @
If nothing lasts forever, will you be my nothing? @
The moment I saw you, I knew we'd fall desperately in love, get married, have kids... @
You can make me the third happiest person here, after the bride and groom.@
That tux looks really good on you. It would also look really good on my floor. Or nicely folded and hung in my closet, if you're a neat freak. @
I won't give my heart to anyone, but if you're brave enough you can try to steal it. @
To be honest, I kind of wanted to nail that other bridesmaid, but you seem to have much lower standards. @
Being single used to mean that nobody wanted you. Now it means you're pretty sexy and you're taking your time deciding how you want your life to be and who you want to spend it with. @
Can I be that somebody? Every love story is beautiful, but ours will be my favorite. @
Hey there. I’m Mr. Right… someone said you were looking for me I want to get married once. No divorce and cheating, just us two till the end. @
